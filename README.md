# Neural Networks using NumPy

The project contains a Jupyter notebook with implementation of simple feedforward neural networks using only NumPy. Specifically, we implement the `Linear` layer, the `ReLU` activation function, the `Softmax` layer and the `Cross Entropy` loss. 

We train two feedforward neural networks for the problem of image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We train the first network for a 2-class classification problem and the second network for a 5-class classification problem. The classes can be any of the classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset.


**Note** - Before running the notebook, download the CIFAR-10 dataset (python version) from [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) and rename the folder to `CIFAR10` and place it in the root directory.
